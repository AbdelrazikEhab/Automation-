# ZeroMQ.js Next Generation

Next generation [ØMQ](http://zeromq.org) bindings for Node.js. The goals of this library are:
* Semantically as similar as possible to the [native](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) ØMQ library.
* High performance.
* Use modern JavaScript and Node.js features such as  `async`/`await` and async iterators.
* Fully usable with TypeScript.

**This library has now been merged back into [ZeroMQ.js](https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq.js).**
